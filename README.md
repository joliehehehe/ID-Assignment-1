# ID-Assignment-1
In this project, I will be creating a portfolio site for my personal art. It aims to show people my art, as well as information about myself.

## Design Process
I designed my website this way as I thought that it would be nice and simple for users to use. This website is for employers who will take a look at my work for an interview.

- As an interested employer/client, I want to be able to have access to a digital portfolio so that I can see the capabilities and skills of the person I might hire.

- As an employer/client, I want to be able to have a way of contacting the artist so that I can express my interest in hiring them, as well as discuss future job offers I might have to offer.

## Features
### Existing Features
- Navigation bar - allows users to navigate to different sections of my page with ease
- 'About Me' section - allows users to understand my personality and my hobbies.
- 'My Works' section - allows users to look through my work that I have done, as well as be aware of what kind of art style I use/can use.
- 'Contact Me' section - allows users to put down their information, which will be sent to me, if they wish to contact me for job offers.

### Features Left to Implement
- 'Achievement' section - allows users to know what achievements I have gotten in the past (mostly art related)
