    <p>Hello! My name is Jolie. I am an aspiring 3D artist and
        designer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic studying to graduate with a
        Diploma in Immersive Media. I love to play online games with
        my friends and draw. I also enjoy watching anime and cartoons.
        My interest in design started in secondary school when my friend
        would often draw characters from shows we watched. Soon after I
        joined the Art Club so I would be able to be exposed to more art
        content. Along the years, our teacher got us to participate in
        various art compeitions Afterwards, I was more keen into learning
        design, which was what brought me into the Immersive Media course.
