                <p>Hello! My name is Jolie. I am an aspiring 3D artist and
                designer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic studying to graduate with a
                Diploma in Immersive Media. I love to play online games with
                my friends and draw. I also enjoy watching anime and cartoons.
                My interest in design started in secondary school when my friend
                would often draw characters from shows we watched. Soon after I
                joined the Art Club so I would be able to be exposed to more art
                content. Along the years, our teacher got us to participate in
                various art compeitions Afterwards, I was more keen into learning
                design, which was what brought me into the Immersive Media course.</p>

                    Poster design for a competition aimed to promote organ donation awareness.

                    <br>
                    The girl in the art piece has passed away due to some unfortunate
                    events. She died peacefully, knowing that her organs would be
                    donated to other people who need it. As seen in the photographs
                    surrounding her, her organs saved the lives of a few people. After
                    recovering, these people went on to do the things they were not able
                    to when they were hospitalised or sick. They were thankful to the girl
                    who gave them a second chance in life, hence, the photographs
                    have the words ‘thank you’ written on them, around her.</div>
