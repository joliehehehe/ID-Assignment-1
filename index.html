                <p>Hello! My name is Jolie. I am an aspiring 3D artist and
                designer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic studying to graduate with a
                Diploma in Immersive Media. I love to play online games with
                my friends and draw. I also enjoy watching anime and cartoons.
                My interest in design started in secondary school when my friend
                would often draw characters from shows we watched. Soon after I
                joined the Art Club so I would be able to be exposed to more art
                content. Along the years, our teacher got us to participate in
                various art compeitions Afterwards, I was more keen into learning
                design, which was what brought me into the Immersive Media course.</p>
